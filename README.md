# Capstone
Capstone for Nashville Software School

- This project will be a Marketing campaign data visualization of Youtube Channels data.
- I will be sourcing data from accros the web and joining them together after a thorough cleaning to create one data set that I will then use to import into Power BI and create a visualization and dashboard.
- After creating said visualization and dashboard I will create a script for my Marketing campaign.
- My intention whith this data set I will create is to find the top Creators on the YouTube platform and create a sponsorship with them to advertize a "New Product" 
- My reasoning behind simply sponsoring this specific Creator is that they would not have to have an ad play or even have one made. Simply by people seeing what product the creator is using could create traffic to the companies website and generate sales. The buyer would see that a specific person (The Creator) is using said product and is performing well in the activity the Creator is partaking in, thus generating the idea that said product is the best in the market.
- Another reason behind this is beacuse of YouTube review Creators. After other Creators see said Creator with sponsorship, viewers will rush to other creator (primarily Creators that do YouTube reviews) and ask for them to review it, Which in turn will generate more sales based off that Creator(s) review(s).
