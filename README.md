# Capstone
Capstone for Nashville Software School

- This project will be a Marketing campaign data visualization of Twitch Channels data.
- I will be sourcing data from across the web and cleaning for my specific needs in Python.
- After cleaning, I will import the data into Power BI and create a visualization and dashboard. After importing the data, I will create a script for my Marketing campaign.
- My intention with this data set is to create a list of the top Creators on the Twitch platform and create a sponsorship with one of them to advertize a "New Product". 
- My reason for sponsoring this speciific channel is so the channel would not need an ad to play or produce one, which would save the company money. By people seeing what product the channel is using, the viewers would be curious and ask about the product, to which the channel would respond with the sponsorship.
- Another reason behind this is beacuse of YouTube "review" channels. After "review" channels see this channel with a sponsorship of this product, viewers will rush to other creators (primarily Creators that do YouTube reviews) and ask for them to review it, Which in turn will generate more sales based off that Creator(s) review(s). 


- After finding all of my data from a real time tracker on https://sullygnome.com/channels/365 I was able to donwload all needed data for my EDA

- I also was able to find a raw data set from the YouTube API on GitHub as I had an unsuccessful atempt to access it myself. 
- To go along with the YouTube data set I acquired I was able to find another data set to go along with the original data set. This data set had only the Channel ID's and the names! I was able to join the two data sets on the channel ID's.

- After an extensive struggle to clean the YouTube data sets I was finally able to drop the Null values and work with the 7,000 rows I was left with. After cleaning to exactly what I needed I exported the data set to a CSV and loaded it into Power BI. 
- While putting together the visualizations for the YouTube data set I noticed the data set was coming back with incorrect data. Unfortunatly that means I was unable to continue using the data.  

-After not being able to use the YouTube data I continued to read in my Twitch data sets. I cleaned up the sets as best as I could. I removed unnamed columns and a few rows as they were not the information I was looking for. I removed the "Just Chatting" row from the highest average viewers data set because I do not consider that a game being played on Twitch.

- I exported my data to CSV once the data sets were cleaned and imported them into Power BI for my visualizations. Once I imported the Twitch data sets I was able to think of a product to "market" I chose the Steelseries Aerox 3 wireless gaming mouse. This mouse is one of the best on the market right now for gaming. Having the Air TrueMove optical sensor that has the fastest response time as well as the TrueMove sensor. The TrueMove sensor allows for full screen movement (Side to Side) on your monitor.

- I chose Steelseries because I use several of their products and I could not recomend them enough! 

- After choosing my producty it was time to conitune on with  my visualizatons in Power BI. First I wanted to look at who has the most followers on Twitch. As I continued creating my visuals I thought about how followers does not really matter when it somes to a sponorship on Twitch. What matters is the average amount of viewers a channel has. I created a visual to show who had the highest average viewersship on Twitch, and in the lead is "Tommyinnit". As I continued on with my visuals, I thought about watch time per channel. I remembered that Twitch records past broadcasts for people to watch after the live stream is over these are called VODs (Video on Demand).

While looking into who had the most watch time I found "Asmongold" who has a total watch time of 94 Million hours on twitch! This is one of my key factors in deciding on who to sponsor for this project.
